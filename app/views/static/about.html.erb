  <section id="about">
    <p>
      WordSmif is an app for exploring our connection between language and internet culture. Users enter any word that is on their minds and we process this information to return word associations and the top trending gif associated with the user's search word and all word associations to show how our minds traditionally make connections in contrast with how we interpret and tag our images through our shared culture. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We wish to show a relationship between our how our minds connect language through associations and how the collective internet culture fosters associations through imagery. We find this to be an interesting intersection and we hope you have fun exploring it.
